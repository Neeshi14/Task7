# Task 7
## 1)
This project analyzes a thyroid dataset to predict thyroid disease status using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

* **Name:**  Thyroid Cancer Risk Dataset
* **Source:** ðŸ”— Dataset Link: Thyroid Cancer Risk Dataset
* **Description:**
* There are 17 features

Hereâ€™s a brief one-line explanation for each feature of dataset:

Patient_ID -> Unique identifier for each patient

Age -> Patientâ€™s age in years

Gender -> Patientâ€™s gender (Male/Female)

Country -> Patientâ€™s country of residence

Ethnicity -> Patientâ€™s ethnic background (Caucasian, Asian, etc)

Family_History -> Whether the patient has a family history of thyroid cance (Yes/No)

Radiation_Exposure -> Whether the patient has been exposed to radiation (Yes/No)

Iodine_Deficiency -> Whether the patient has iodine deficiency (Yes/No)

Smoking -> Whether the patient is a smoker (Yes/No)

Obesity -> Whether the patient is classified as obese (Yes/No)

Diabetes -> Whether the patient has diabetes (Yes/No)

TSH_Level -> Level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in blood (mIU/L)

T3_Level -> Level of triiodothyronine (T3) hormone in blood (nmol/L)

T4_Level -> Level of thyroxine (T4) hormone in blood (nmol/L)

Nodule_Size -> Size of thyroid nodules (cm)

Thyroid_Cancer_Risk -> Assessed risk level (Low, Medium, High)

Diagnosis -> Final thyroid diagnosis (Benign, Malignant)


## Project Overview

* **Goal:**  classify nodules as benign/malignant
* **Methods:** The neural networks are used.
* **Results:** The model achieved 82.87% accuracy on the test set.

In these the simple linear neural network using the pytorch.
